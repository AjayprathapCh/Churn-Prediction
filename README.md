## Customer Churn Prediction at a Telecom Company

**Case Summary:**

Mobicom is a telecom carrier, which is experiencing high customer churn rate. When an Industry Survey report showed that the market is experiencing falling ARPU and high customer churn rate, the senior management at Mobicom is concerned that it will effect Mobicom even harder as they are already experiencing high customer churn. 

In order to mitigate this industry phenomenon, at Mobicom, the senior management wanted to retain customers with the help of targeted proactive retention programs as opposed to the current case based reactive approach. In order to come up with different retention programs and target customers for each of these programs, Mobicom wanted to understand their customersâ€™ churn behavior and factors influencing it.

**Problem Statement:**

Identify customers who would likely to churn and factors influencing their churn behavior; in order to help Mobicom retain them with the help of various proactive retention programs.
